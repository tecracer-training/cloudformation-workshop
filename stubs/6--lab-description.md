# Lab 6: Mappings
Reuse template from lab 5.
Add mapping region -> AMI.
Use map to determine AMI for EC2 instance.
Update/Create CloudFormation stack.
(hint: AWS updates AMIs periodically - probably the AMIs in your code won't work anymore. Check the AMI Ids in EC2 Console)

## Test your Stack
check running instances in EC2 Console. Create your stack in a different region
